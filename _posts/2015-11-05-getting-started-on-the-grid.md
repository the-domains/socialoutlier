Twitter's "Tailored Audience" features allow you to examine each customer at an individual level,so you can select whatever information most interests that particular person and present your campaign highlighting that focus. With this "tailored audience," marketers can now pinpoint their marketing campaigns and deliver them at the most productive time to the most receptive prospects with data that Twitter provides.

Offer What They'll Want Now. You can deliver a customized message to prospects based on what's in their online shopping carts. Ever been tempted by "you want fries with that?"
